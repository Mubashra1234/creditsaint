            <h1>Your California Privacy Rights</h1>
            <p class='section-paragraph'><strong>IMPORTANT PRIVACY NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS</strong></p>
            <p class='section-paragraph'><strong>LAST REVISED: March 29, 2020</strong></p>
            <p class='section-paragraph'>This Privacy Notice for California Consumers (“Notice”), provided by Credit Saint, LLC (“Credit Saint,” “Company,” “we,” or “our”), supplements, and is expressly made part of, the information contained in Credit Saint’s <a href="https://www.creditsaint.com/privacy-policy">Online Privacy Policy</a> and applies solely to those who are consumers (“you” or “your”) as defined in Section 1798.140(g) of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). We adopt this Notice in compliance with the CCPA and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Notice.</p>
            <p class='section-paragraph'> Credit Saint collects information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device (“personal information”). As a consumer, you have certain rights regarding your personal information as defined in the CCPA. This Notice provides you with information on how Credit Saint collects, uses, and shares personal information. It also outlines the rights you have regarding personal information that we collect from you and describes how you can exercise those rights.</p>
            <h3 class='section-heading'>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h3>
            <p class='section-paragraph'>As a company that conducts activities that are financial in nature, Credit Saint is a “financial institution” as that term is defined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”). While the CCPA does not exempt financial institutions, and thus, Credit Saint, from its requirements, Section 1798.145(e) of the CCPA does exempt personal information collected by a financial institution pursuant to the GLBA. Accordingly, much, if not all, of the data consumers provide to Credit Saint, or that we collect from consumers, will fall within the GLBA exemption to the CCPA’s definition of personal information and thus outside the scope of the CCPA.</p>
            <p class='section-paragraph'>Credit Saint recognizes the eleven (11) broad categories of personal information referenced in the CCPA that a business may collect about a consumer. In particular, Credit Saint has collected the following categories of personal information from consumers within the last twelve (12) months (though most, if not all, such personal information is collected pursuant to the GLBA and is thus exempt from the CCPA):</p>

Such notice may be delivered, for example, by posting an updated California Privacy Notice.</p>
            <h3 class='section-heading'>Sharing Personal Information</h3>
            <p class='section-paragraph'>Credit Saint may disclose your personal information to a third party service provider for business purposes.

            </ul>
            <h3 class='section-heading'>Disclosure of Personal Information for a Business Purpose</h3>
            <p class='section-paragraph'> The CCPA requires Credit Saint to provide you with a statement on its personal information disclosures for a business purpose that reference the eleven (11) categories of information reflected in the chart above. In the preceding twelve (12) months, Credit Saint has disclosed the following categories of personal information for a business purpose:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class='section-paragraph'>Category A: Identifiers.</li>

If we receive and confirm your consumer request as verifiable, unless an exception applies we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records.</p>
            <p class='section-paragraph'>The CCPA provides a number a reasons why a deletion request may be denied. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>

            <p class='section-paragraph'>Credit Saint endeavors to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of receiving it. If Credit Saint requires additional time to process your request, up to a maximum total of ninety (90) days from the date the request is received, we will notify you of this and inform you of the reason for requiring the additional time.</p>
            <p class='section-paragraph'>If you have an online account with us, we will deliver our written response to your online account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request or have denied a request, if applicable.</p>
            <p class='section-paragraph'>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

            <p class='section-paragraph'>Credit Saint will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights as described above. Unless permitted by the CCPA, Credit Saint will not:</p>
