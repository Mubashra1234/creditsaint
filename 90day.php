			<h1>Credit Saint 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee</h1>
			<div><img src="./assets/img/moneyback-guarantee.svg" alt="Credit Saint 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee" class="moneyback" /></div>
			<p class="section-paragraph">The goal of our service is to remove questionable negative information from credit reports. This is not an exact science and there are cases in which we may be unsuccessful. Our clients are protected with our 90 day warranty. If you sign up for service with Credit Saint in any program, and do not see any questionable items deleted from your credit in 90 days, you will be entitled to a full refund. This does not mean that your credit will be fixed completely during that period but you should see some of your questionable negative items deleted in this period or your money back. (subject to the terms and conditions set forth below). To apply for a refund please contact your service specialist by phone, so your identity can be verified.</p>
			<p class="section-paragraph">The Credit Saint money-back guarantee will be strictly subject to you complying with the following terms and conditions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="section-paragraph">Eligibility for a refund does not start until day 90. You must be an active participant in the program for 90 days.  Cancellation or failure to pay during the initial 90 days of the program is a void of this guarantee.</li>
				<li class="section-paragraph">That you do not create or cause any new derogatory trade lines to be added to your credit report after your participation in the applicable program begins;</li>
				<li class="section-paragraph">You make all payments due and owing to Credit Saint per this agreement in a timely manner.</li>
				<li class="section-paragraph">You mail, fax or email to Credit Saint proof of your identity such as a copy of driver’s license and copy of social security card within five (“5”) days of the effective date of this agreement.</li>
				<li class="section-paragraph">You agree to give Credit Saint thirty (“30”) days from the date you have requested a refund to allow Credit Saint adequate time to review your credit bureaus and audit your account to verify that no negative items have been removed from your account and to ascertain the reason for this occurring.</li>
				<li class="section-paragraph">Refund audits must be requested between 91 and 120 days from the receipt of your first payment which activates your account. If you choose to continue in the program beyond 120 days, you waive the right to request a refund.</li>
